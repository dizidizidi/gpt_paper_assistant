 # this file goes into the prompt to tell the bot your interest areas. you can write down your interests in whatever format you want
 # they can be simple, like a one line description like
 1. Relates to cryptography, but not relates to ML, AI, ChatGPT, CV and NLP. Less relates to cryptanalysis and security attacks.
 # or in the case of more general areas like `instruction-following`, you might want to give examples
 2. Relates to proof systems such as PCP, IOP, and argument systems, but not relates to ML, AI, ChatGPT, CV and NLP. Less relates to cryptanalysis and security attacks.
 3. Relates to quantum cryptography, but not relates to ML, AI, ChatGPT, CV and NLP. Less relates to cryptanalysis and security attacks.
 4. Applies complexity theory to cryptography, but not relates to ML, AI, ChatGPT, CV and NLP. Less relates to cryptanalysis and security attacks.
 5. Relates to computational complexity, but not relates to ML, AI, ChatGPT, CV and NLP. Less relates to cryptanalysis and security attacks.
 5. Relates to coding theory and has applications in cryptography, but not relates to ML, AI, ChatGPT, CV and NLP. Less relates to cryptanalysis and security attacks.
